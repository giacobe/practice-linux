* Welcome to the Polylinux practice system.             *    
*                                                       *
* In this system, you can practice navigating the file  *
* system. You can also practice manipulating the file   *
* system. Any commands that you enter will adjust the   *
* files on this system.                                 *
*                                                       *
* You can't really hurt anything. This computer exists  *
* only in your browser. So, feel free to make any       *
* changes that you want.  To start completely over,     * 
* simply reload this web page and everyhing will revert *
* to its original state.                                *
*                                                       *
* You are currently in the /root directory and you are  *
* logged on as the root user. You will find several     *
* subdirectories and files here. Look at them. Copy     *
* them. Delete them. Change them. Try some Linux        *
* commands.                                             *
*                                                       *
* When you are ready, you can move on to the "practice" *
* virtual machine and the instructions to "practice"    *
* some more.                                            *
